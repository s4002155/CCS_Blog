_This is the end result, what I copied Rafaël Rozendaal's work as closely as possible._

# Which work by Rafaël Rozendaal did I choose?

Among Rafaël Rozendaal's various works, I chose **on and off .org**, created in 2003. The biggest feature of this work is that the switch icon changes depending on the mouse movement.

## working process
![created switch icons](/240315_second_HW/illust_icon.png)
This work is made up of switch icons. I could have created this icon through p5.js like the last respone, but the icon would be a bit complicated to implement with code, so I decided to use a method that loads the icon as an image to try a new method that is different from the last time.

Therefore, the first thing I did was create an on and off switch icon using Adobe Illustrator.
