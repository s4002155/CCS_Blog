# Brainstorm ideas regarding what community of practice you might engage with for your AT3 project.

### Its domain
The community I belong to is “People who like to draw.” Passionate about art and interested in creative expression.

We have a problem with running out of ideas to draw new pictures every time, and drawing pictures with repetitive drawing methods has become a bit boring. To solve this, we hope to inspire us in interesting ways and experience drawing like never before.

### Its shared values
Here's what my community members consider important:
-  **Creativity**: We respect and encourage each person's unique ideas and style.
- **Collaboration**: We learn and grow from each other by creating joint work.
- **Inspiration**: Get inspired by each other's work and explore different techniques and approaches.
- **Support**: We exchange feedback on our work and help each other grow.

### Its existing repertoire
- **Social media chat**: Includes informal communication and sharing through platforms such as Instagram and KakaoTalk.
- **Offline meeting**: Meet irregularly to draw together or exchange stories about drawings.

### How you might broker some creative coding repertoire to this new context
Main function -
1. **Finding inspiration from random *somethings***: Sometimes, ideas that come from things you never imagined are a good way to get inspiration. The idea started from this thought, and I hope that we can get ideas for drawing through randomly generated lines or shapes.

2. **Real-time drawing**: I hope that collaboration and support will be resolved through the ability for multiple users to draw at the same time. By drawing together on the same page, we can exchange ideas with each other, get inspired by each other's work, and help each other grow. We can also receive positive stimulation by seeing drawing style develop differently.
