_This is the final result of creating a grid by using a for loop._

# How might I use for loops to create a grid?

![screenshot of existing code](/240306_first_post/existing_code.png)
I started with the code from the sketch that I created in class to use the for loop.

![Adjusted the scale of the square](/240306_first_post/scale_adjustment.png)
The code for the sketch created in class was created so that the scale of the square is adjusted according to frameCount.

However, to create a grid, I need squares with a fixed scale, so the first thing I did was change the scale of the squares to **70**.
